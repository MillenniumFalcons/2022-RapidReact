# Kicker Wheels

This subsystem is responsible for accelerating balls from the column to the flywheel.


## Motors
- 1 Falcon 500 motor

## Solenoids
N/A
  

## Sensors
- Falcon built in encoders


## Closed loop
Using built in Falcon 500 encoders.

We will be using kicker wheel surface speed (so that it matches the surface speed of the flywheel).

### Units
- Position: N/A
- Velocity: m/s
- Acceleration: RPM/s^2


## SysId
- Need to find kS, kV (kA probably doesn't matter)
