# Bottom Feeder

This subsystem is responsible for moving balls from the intake to the column.


## Motors
- 1 Falcon 500 motors
  

## Sensors
- Falcon built in encoders


## Closed loop
Using built in Falcon 500 encoders.

For closed loop we want to be able to move a ball a set amount of distance in the bottom feeder, and we also want to be able to move in a specific velocity for when we want to match the speed of the column.

We want the surface speed of the belts that are touching the balls.

## Units
- Position: inches
- Velocity: inches/s
- Acceleration: inches/s^2


## SysId
- Need to find kS, kV (kA probably doesn't matter)
